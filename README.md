# ModelAPITest
Program for testing and exploring ModelAPI functionality, specially for Feature Toggle Thesis

## Description

Simple Screens OMLs are just plain blank applications with two screens: Screen1 and Screen2.

Screen1 has two web blocks: WebBlock1 and WebBlock2.

In SimpleScreens2, Screen2 has one web block: WebBlock3

*SimpleScreensTW.oml* is for traditional web while *SimpleScreensNR.oml* is for React.

You can use these files to test the program that lists all screens and all webblocks of an oml file.

You can also use SimpleScreens and SimpleScreens2 to test the listing of new and altered elements.

This program now encapsulates WebBlock3 of Screen2 in a simple if.

The current program is written for both **Traditional Web** and **Reactive**. Keep in mind that to list altereations and new elements, both omls must be in the same language

## Running

For running, execute the program and then insert the desired file paths in the console for both versions of the program.
