# ModelAPITest
Program for testing and exploring ModelAPI functionality, specially for Feature Toggle Thesis

## Description

Simple Screens OMLs are just plain blank applications with a couple screens and WebBlocks.

*SimpleScreensTW.oml* is for traditional web while *SimpleScreensNR.oml* is for React.

You can use these files to test the program that lists all screens and all webblocks of an oml file.

At current version, the Test Files working and more relevant are: SimpleScreensTW.1.oml and SimpleScreens5TW.1.oml for traditional, and SimpleScreensNR.1.oml and SimpleScreens5TW.1.oml for Reactive.

This program now encapsulates all new blocks and screens (this last by encapsulating all links redirecting to it and a preparation/oninitialize for the screen) in a toggle.

The current program is written for both **Traditional Web** and **Reactive**. Keep in mind that both omls must be in the same language

## Running

For running, execute the program and then insert the desired file paths for both versions of the program, as well as the path for the output file.
